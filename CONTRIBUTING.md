## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+ (we test with 20.x, 22.x, 24.x)
- npm or yarn
- Docker (for container testing)
- Access to a Fronius device (for testing)

### Local Development

```bash
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fronius-mcp-server.git
cd fronius-mcp-server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Test connection to Fronius device
FRONIUS_HOST=your-fronius-ip npm run test-connection
```

### Docker Development

```bash
# Build Docker image
npm run docker:build

# Test Docker image
npm run docker:test
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing

1. **Connection Testing**: Always test with a real Fronius device when possible
2. **API Coverage**: Test all relevant MCP tools and resources
3. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid configurations and network issues
4. **Docker Testing**: Verify container builds and runs correctly

### Fronius Device Testing

If you have access to a Fronius device:

```bash
# Set your Fronius device details
export FRONIUS_HOST=192.168.1.100
export FRONIUS_PROTOCOL=http  # or https
export FRONIUS_PORT=80        # or 443

# Test connection
npm run test-connection

# Test with Claude Desktop
# Configure Claude Desktop and test various queries
```

### Test Coverage

We aim to test:
- All API endpoints with real devices when possible
- Error handling and edge cases
- Docker container functionality
- Different Fronius device models and firmware versions
